Every single channel is running the same recycled garbage, and not one of them has a shred of originality or integrity left. What happened to investigative journalism? What happened to actual reporting where they dig into the facts instead of just parroting whatever press release comes their way? And dont even get me started on the bias! Its like every network has an agenda, and theyâ€™re not even trying to hide it anymore. I dont care what side of the political spectrum youre on, its all just noise and sensationalism now. Theyre more interested in getting clicks and eyeballs than telling us whats really going on.",
